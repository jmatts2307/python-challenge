# python-challenge
In this homework, I created two scripts to go through two given datasets named 'budget_data.csv'
and 'election_data.csv': 

On PyBank I was tasked to find:
*Total number of months included in the dataset
*Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
*Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and 
 then average those Changes
*Greatest increase and decrease in profits over the entire period

On Pypoll I was tasked to find:
*Total number of votes cast
*Complete list of candidates who received votes
*Percentage of votes each candidate won
*Total number of votes each candidate won
*Winner of the election based on popular votes

Both results are able to be printed onto the terminal and export a 
text file with results.
